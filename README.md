#Raspberry pi timelaspe project
This is my AS level coursework, the idea is simple.
Make a small cheap timelapse camera with a raspberry pi (running headlessly), and see how it works out

##Hopes
1.Power usage
..* Run for at least 6 hours on a batter so it can be moved arround

2.Ease of use for the use
..* The user must be able to input there own values and need as little help as possible
..* Be given a semi-graphical suer interface so they can see what they are inputting and how long it has left to until it finishes
..* The user has to able to retreive the final output with out physicaly touching the pi

3.Tenchinal
..* Take and store all of the files while leaving enough room for the output file
..* Convert all of the images required in to a 24fps .mp4 file for convenience
